# 💰 NeuroArte DAO — Royalties and Secondary Sales Policy

## 🎯 Overview

This document defines the royalty distribution and secondary sales policy for all artworks tokenized under **NeuroArte DAO** smart contracts.

The model ensures fairness to artists, supports ongoing scientific research, and funds the DAO’s governance and sustainability.

---

## ⚙️ Royalty Mechanism

All artworks minted by the DAO comply with the **ERC-2981 NFT Royalty Standard**, ensuring compatibility with all major marketplaces (Manifold, OpenSea, Foundation, etc.).

**Royalties automatically apply to all on-chain secondary sales.**

---

## 💸 Distribution of Royalties (Secondary Sales)

A 10% royalty is applied to every resale of an artwork.  
This amount is distributed as follows:

- 🎨 **70%** → Original Artist  
- 🧬 **20%** → Scientific Research Fund  
- 🏛️ **10%** → DAO Treasury Fund  

📊 *Example:* For a 1 ETH resale, 0.1 ETH is distributed as royalties:  
- 0.07 ETH to the artist  
- 0.02 ETH to the research fund  
- 0.01 ETH to the DAO fund

---

## 📈 Primary Sales (Minted Works)

For first-time sales (minting through DAO contracts), revenue is distributed as follows:

- 70% → Artist (creator of the work)  
- 20% → Research Fund  
- 10% → DAO Treasury  

---

## 🔗 Automation

All royalty and revenue distributions are managed automatically through smart contracts, guaranteeing transparency and verifiability on-chain.  

Every transaction is recorded immutably and visible via blockchain explorers.

---

## ⚖️ Licensing Terms

All works under NeuroArte DAO are licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike).  

This allows free use for non-commercial purposes, as long as the DAO and the artist are credited, and derivative works share the same license.
